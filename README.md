# The Little Python Computer

A python implementation of the [Little Man Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer) meant for
use in CI/CD (i.e. GitHub Actions) to verify student programs using the LMC ISA. This implementation uses the 
traditional instruction set plus one additional instruction meant to emulate bit-shifting (as implemented using
another paper computer, the [CARDIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARDboard_Illustrative_Aid_to_Computation).
